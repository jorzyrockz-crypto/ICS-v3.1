Last updated: 2026-02-15
Main file: `ics_v_3_standalone_index.html`

## Newly Implemented (2026-02-15, unserviceable/archive/WMR/batch-print workflow refinements + table scroll + toast containment)
- Unserviceable modal workflow and data structure upgrades:
  - replaced legacy situation list with six numbered situations and mapped remarks/notes guidance
  - split Unserviceable capture into separate `Remarks` and `Notes` fields
  - changed `Remarks` from freeform area to situation-dependent dropdown
  - added dynamic guidance rendering for selected situation and persisted `remarks` in inspection logs
  - improved Inspection History table structure (`Situation`, `Remark`, `Notes`, richer `Recorded` metadata with WMR-prepared markers)
- Action Center table and archive gating updates:
  - added EUL Action Center `Remarks` column after `Inspection`, sourced from latest inspection (with fallback inference for legacy logs)
  - archive row action now enables only when latest inspection is `unserviceable` and has remarks
  - added server-side/runtime guard in `openArchiveModal(...)` to enforce same archive precondition
  - archive modal `Cancel` now closes only (no automatic return to Unserviceable modal)
- WMR save/archive behavior realignment:
  - WMR `Save` now archives selected WMR-prepared items directly into `Archived Disposal Items` as new rows
  - save flow removes archived items from active `icsRecords`, updates lineage/audit, and keeps per-row/archive print actions usable
  - added `Archive Approval Status` field in WMR and wired value into archived disposal status (instead of forced approved state)
  - WMR draft fields now clear after successful save/archive, with default `Place of Storage` restored
  - `Place of Storage` now supports autosuggest (`datalist`) from record + archived WMR history
- Archives batch print builder mode:
  - `Batch Print WMR` now opens builder mode in WMR panel (instead of immediate multi-print sequence)
  - builder supports item matching by `Item No.` or `ICS/ItemNo`, auto-adds matched row, and appends a fresh input row for repeat entry
  - added item autosuggest list in builder input and conditional `Print` button (shown when 2+ rows selected)
  - added builder `Cancel` control and `Esc` behavior to exit builder mode cleanly
  - removed hard one-ICS restriction for builder print selection; mixed ICS entries can now print in one generated form
- Notification/UI containment and table overflow handling:
  - fixed stray toast rendering in Archives by excluding `wasteReportOverlay` from modal-toast host targets
  - enabled automatic horizontal scroll-on-overflow behavior for table wrappers, including Action Center EUL table (`actions-eul-wrap`)

## Newly Implemented (2026-02-15, archives WMR workspace migration + action/archive workflow realignment)

- Inspection/Action workflow changes:
  - removed top-level print button from Inspection History modal; retained per-row print icon action only
  - moved `Archive Item` initiation from Unserviceable modal to EUL Action Center row Actions column (after Inspection History) with subtle divider
  - removed `Archive Item` button from Unserviceable modal markup (including fallback injected modal template)
- WMR workflow migration to Archives:
  - moved WMR draft surface from modal stack into Archives view as inline staged-style panel
  - Archives now hosts WMR draft above Archived Disposal table for one-surface workflow
  - WMR panel redesigned to staged-style composition:
    - title changed to `Waste Materials Report` with `DRAFT` pill
    - removed close button and retained Save-only footer action
    - removed visible auto-populated summary block (ICS/entity/item-count/prepared-at)
    - removed Additional Notes field
    - reordered layout so items table appears before signatories
    - signatories arranged as 4-column row with subtle divider above section
    - default blank row seeded in items table when no active WMR target is loaded
- Archives disposal actions and printing:
  - added per-row `Print Waste Materials Report` icon in Archived Disposal Actions column (disabled when no prepared WMR metadata)
  - moved Batch Print WMR control from Action Center to Archived Disposal container header
  - added archived-scope batch print handler that prints prepared archived entries within current Archives filter scope

## Newly Implemented (2026-02-15, dashboard recent-activity extraction + records/action-center behavior refinements)
- Dashboard recent-activity modularization and redesign:

## Product Direction Notes
- App works offline (single standalone HTML + localStorage + inline SVG/CSS).
- For selling to many schools:
  - free backend tiers are prototype only
  - if cloud sync is needed, use paid multi-tenant architecture
  - offline commercial path should include packaging + licensing strategy

## Missing / Next Priority Work (Recommended Order)
1. Packaging/licensing
   - installable build (Tauri/Electron)
   - license activation/update path
2. Continue modular refactor

   - finalize module boundaries and load order checks
3. Schema migration map
   - formal historical schema migration definitions (currently compatibility parsing + normalization)

  - per-record status metadata stored in `_statusMeta`:
    - `type` (`new` / `imported` / `updated`)
    - `at` timestamp
    - `by` username (current profile)
  - compact color-coded info marker beside ICS number with tooltip:
    - status + actor + timestamp
  - ICS/Entity table readability updates:
    - wider ICS column
    - one-line ICS with ellipsis + tooltip
    - explicit Entity text wrapping

## Newly Implemented (2026-02-12, security hardening)
- Backup/export packages now include integrity metadata:
  - SHA-256 checksum
  - canonicalization tag (`sorted-json-v1`)
  - integrity target (`package-without-integrity`)
- Import/restore verification gate added in Data Manager:
  - checksum verification status panel in Validation Preview
  - full-backup restore is blocked if checksum is missing/invalid
  - schema package restore is blocked on checksum mismatch/unsupported algorithm
  - Apply Import stays disabled until verification passes
- Backup audit entry now includes checksum fingerprint prefix.

## Newly Implemented (2026-02-12, school identity lock)
- School identity configuration added in Profile:
  - School Name
  - School ID (`4-12` digit lock value, e.g. `114656`)
- Active school identity now appears in top bar as context (`School Name [ID: ...]`).
- Export packages now include `schoolIdentity` metadata.
- Import verification now checks school lock compatibility:
  - blocks restore on School ID mismatch
  - blocks full-backup restore when School ID metadata is missing
  - allows non-full legacy imports with warning when School ID metadata is missing
- Validation Preview now shows package School ID when available.
- First-run/setup enforcement:
  - app now prompts a dedicated Setup/Sign-up modal on boot when School ID is missing
  - data actions are blocked until School Name + School ID are configured
  - setup modal includes school + first personnel creation flow
- Shared-computer login flow:
  - required login modal on boot (School ID + profile selection)
  - profile list is nested per School ID (`icsSchoolProfiles`)
  - data actions require active session login in addition to school lock
  - login modal includes `New Personnel` path for creating additional profiles under the same school
  - optional `Remember this device` session restore across refresh
  - explicit `Sign Out` actions in sidebar widget and Profile modal
  - dedicated Setup/Sign-up modal used for first-time school + personnel onboarding (instead of Profile modal)
  - sidebar profile widget added and compacted:
    - avatar + username + role
    - username area opens Profile settings
    - vector Sign Out icon beside identity block
- Setup modal UX refresh:
  - solid-color backdrop (no blur)
  - animated gradient border treatment

## Remaining Gaps After This Session
- Add formal migration map per historical schema version (currently normalized through compatibility parsing).
- Add automated regression checks for module loading order and critical workflows.

## Smoke Test Checklist (Quick Regression Pass)
1. Boot + Navigation
   - Open app and confirm Dashboard renders.
   - Switch views: Dashboard, Manage Inventory, Action Center, Archives.
2. Profile + Security
   - Open Profile side menu tabs and save without errors.
   - In Security tab, confirm `Data Integrity Check` summary renders.
   - Run `Repair Missing Profile Keys` (Admin) and confirm completion summary.
3. Import Preview
   - Load legacy JSON in Import Center.
   - Run `Validate JSON Trace` and confirm report appears.
   - Confirm Validation Preview shows `Trace Migrated` KPI when applicable.
   - Open `Migration Details` and verify row/field list appears.
4. Export Paths
   - Export Records package and Full package from Export Center.
   - Export single ICS from records table.
   - Verify payloads include `exportedByProfileKey` and trace profile-key fields.
5. Role Guardrails
   - Login as non-Admin profile and verify restricted actions are blocked with clear message.
6. Undo Snapshot
   - Run a trace repair or apply import, then use `Undo Last Data Change` in Profile Security (Admin).
   - Confirm records/activity are restored to previous state.

## Resume Prompt (Copy for New Chat)
Use `PROJECT_STATUS.md` as baseline and continue from current fully modularized multi-file runtime. Current baseline includes centralized access control guards, immutable per-record lineage timeline with hash checks, device/session-attributed audits, and extracted modules (`core-storage-security.js`, `core-lineage-audit.js`, `core-data-manager.js`, `core-records-workflow.js`, `core-actions-workflow.js`, `core-profile-session.js`, `core-theme-preferences.js`, `core-school-setup-ui.js`, `core-profile-modal.js`, `core-shell-init.js`, `core-dashboard-view.js`, `core-dashboard-render.js`, `core-inventory-view-render.js`, `core-actions-view-render.js`, `core-archives-view-render.js`, `core-dashboard-actions.js`, `core-dashboard-metrics.js`, `core-app-bootstrap.js`, `core-keyboard-routing.js`, `core-notifications.js`, `core-ui-event-wiring.js`, `core-modal-system.js`, `core-shell-view-state.js`, `core-main-entry.js`). Next priority: packaging/licensing, then formal schema migration map and regression checks.
